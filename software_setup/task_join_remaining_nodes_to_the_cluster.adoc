After creating a new cluster, you use the Cluster Setup wizard to join each remaining node to the cluster one at a time. The wizard helps you to configure each node's node management interface.

When you join two nodes in a cluster, you are creating a high availability (HA) pair. If you join 4 nodes, you create two HA pairs. To learn more about HA, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/high-availability/index.html[Learn about HA].

You can only join one node to the cluster at a time. When you start to join a node to the cluster, you must complete the join operation for that node, and the node must be part of the cluster before you can start to join the next node.

*Best Practice:* If you have a FAS2720 with 24 or fewer NL-SAS drives, you should verify that the storage configuration default is set to active/passive to optimize performance.

. Log in to the node you plan to join in the cluster.
+
Cluster Setup wizard starts on the console.
+
----
Welcome to the cluster setup wizard....
----
. Acknowledge the AutoSupport statement.
+
NOTE: AutoSupport is enabled by default.

+
----
Type yes to confirm and continue {yes}: yes
----

. Follow the instructions on the screen to assign an IP address to the node.
. Join the node to the cluster: `join`
. Follow the instructions on the screen to set up the node and join it to the cluster.
. After setup is completed, verify that the node is healthy and eligible to participate in the cluster: `cluster show`

The following example shows a cluster after the second node (cluster1-02) has been joined to the cluster:
+
----
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
cluster1-01           true    true
cluster1-02           true    true

You can access the Cluster Setup wizard to change any of the values you entered for the admin SVM or node SVM by using the `cluster setup` command.

. Repeat this task for each remaining node.
